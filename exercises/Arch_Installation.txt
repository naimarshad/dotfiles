mkdir -p /mnt/home
mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi

Then mount the actual partitions where the Arch installation will be placed to these mount points inside the bootstrap image. In the following commands the actual block names on my system are shown; be sure to substitute your own device names. Mount the partition to be used for Arch's / partition with:
mount /dev/sda25 /mnt

Mount the partition to be Arch's /home partition with:
mount /dev/sda26 /mnt/home

Mount the EFI System partition with:
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot/efi

Activate the swap partition so that it is recognized by Arch's fstab generation script with:
swapon -s

Now it's time to get excited. The actual installation of the base Arch system happens with the following command:
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel

The next step will be to generate the /etc/fstab file for the new Arch system, which is done with: 
genfstab -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

hwclock --systohc --utc

set the system locale by editing the /etc/locale.gen file to uncomment the appropriate locale. For me this meant uncommenting en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8. An ISO locale encoding is also available in the file, but Arch recommends using the UTF encoding. 

nano /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen
echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
mkinitcpio -p linux

Create the root password with the following command, entering the desired password at the prompts.
passwd

Install the Graphics Driver and the X Window System
The rest of the installation begins with installing the graphics driver which will install many components as dependencies. Since my system uses an integrated Intel graphics chip, I installed the intel driver.

pacman -S xf86-video-intel

Install the other packages related to the video driver.
pacman -S mesa-libgl
pacman -S libva-intel-driver libva

Install the Desktop Environment
pacman -S gnome gnome-extra
pacman -S gnome-tweak-tool


pacman -S alsa-utils alsa-plugins
pacman -S libpulse

useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash naimarshad
pacman -S gdm
systemctl enable gdm.services

pacman -S grub
pacman -S efibootmgr
Install the bootloader into the EFI partition.
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=arch --recheck

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
