Follow this check list:

> upgrade all radios to the latest firmware
> set each of the three radios to a different
   IP address
> set the Rocket network mode to bridge
> set the Rocket wireless to AP-WDS mode; choose a
   channel in the 5800MHz range; set its SSID [wireless 'name']
> set each NanoStation to bridge mode,
> set each NanoStaton to station-WDS mode; with the same
   channel and the same SSID of the rocket
Let us know if the radios now associate.  Dave
