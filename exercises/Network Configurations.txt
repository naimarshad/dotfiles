1- Ethernet configuration 
 a- How to configure network On Ubuntu

 i- Edit the related Ethernet card configuration for example for eth0 by opening it through "vi /etc/network/interface

 auto eth0				//this means on boot it will activate the eth0 card
 iface eth0 inet static 		//will tell the card to load the static configuration
 address 192.168.50.1			//will assign the ip to the machine statically
 netmask 255.255.255.0			//will determine the netmask of the network
 gateway 192.168.50.1 			//will determine the gateway to the ineternet
 
 ii- For adding the nameservers we must have to edit the configurations in file /etc/resolv.conf for open it with vi /etc/resolv.conf

 nameserver=208.67.222.222
 nameserver=208.67.220.220

each nameserver will be separated by one on separate line, save the file & exit.

  iii-- Now if everything goes well you can restart the network service & can monitor the effects accordingly.

  "service network restart" or simply reboot the machine

 b- How to configure network On CentOS
Every Ethernet card has a related configuration files in /etc/sysconfig/networ-scripts/ifcfg-"NIC"

For example if you have only one network card in your machine its ip configuration should be stored with in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 & if you have multiple network cards then the "0" at the end of eth will be increased to higher number such as eth1, eth2 etc..

  i- For IP configuration changes you must edit the related files of that particular network card for example for eth0 to do it vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/eth0

 DEVICE=Eth0
 ONBOOT=yes or no
 BOOTPROTO=none or dhcp
 USERCTL =yes or no
 NM_CONTROLLED=yes or no
 IPADDR=192.168.50.10
 NETMASK=255.255.255.0
 BROADCAST=192.168.50.255

save the file & exit. 

  ii- For CentOS adding the gateway is not inside the configuration file of Ethernet card but it is to be added in /etc/sysconfig/network/

 to do it vi /etc/sysconfig/network
 
 NETWORKING=yes
 HOSTNAME=centos-srv.localdomain
 GATEWAY=192.168.50.1

save the file & exit. 
  iii- For adding the nameservers we must have to edit the configuration in file /etc/resolv.conf for editing it vi /etc/resolv.conf

 nameserver=208.67.222.222
 nameserver=208.67.220.220

each nameserver will be separated by one on separate line, save the file & exit.

  iv- Now if everything goes well you can restart the network service & can monitor the effects accordingly.

  v- service network restart or simply reboot the machine

2- Bonding configuration

Bonding actually means that you can utilize the multiple card of a server to work together. There are several ways that your card can work together.s

Linux kernel can work in seven differrent mode.
 0- balance-rr 		//it means that ports sending & recieving packets equally & it offers LB/FT
 1- active-backup	//it means that you have working one port & one is as active backup means one of the port will be alsways in-active & it just provides FT
 2- balance-xor		//it means that ports send packets based on mac address & it offers both LB/FT
 3- 
 4- 802.3ad		//it means LB/FT based on switch support, if your switch supports
 5- balance-tlb		//it means 
 6- balance-alb		//

 Bonding with in the linux
 1- CentOS
 2- Ubuntu

1- CentOS
As earlier we configured the network card, in similar way you have to edit/create the bonded interface. If you want to create a bonded interface you have to put the configuration in "/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0" 

 "vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0"

 DEVICE=bond0
 ONBOOT=yes
 BOOTPROTO=none
 USERCTL=no
 IPADDR=192.168.50.10
 NETWORK=192.168.50.0
 NETMASK=255.255.255.0

That's the similar way in which we edit our ethernet card files, only differrence is bond0 interface physcially not existing. After adding these lines int bond0 file save & quit the editor.

Now we have to modify the configuration for the physcial interfaces, for example for eth0 it should look like this;
 
 "vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0"

 DEVICE=eth0
 ONBOOT=yes
 BOOTPROTO=none
 USERCTL=no
 MASTER=bond0
 SLAVE=yes

save & quit the editor. Similarly for the eth1 card it would be something like this;

 "vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1"
 
 DEVICE=eth1
 ONBOOT=yes
 BOOTPROTO=none
 USERCTL=no
 MASTER=bond0
 SLAVE=yes

save & quit the editor.

As of now their is no bonded device available yet, so we have to create a bonded device by adding a kernel module.

 cd /etc/modeprobe.d/ and create a new file bonding.conf, we can call it any name we want.

 vi/etc/modeprob.d/bonding.conf
 
 alias bond0 bonding			//this means it is linking the bond0 device to bonding kernel module.
 options bond0 mode=6 miimon=100	//These are the options such as when to refresh the state of the network card & type of the bonding. In this example we have configured the bonding for active-backup.
