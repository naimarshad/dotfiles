This will help to get trusted.

How to enable SSL in Postfix:

Step 1 (Generating the Certificate files)

Please note:

Please change "mail.alamal-sa.com" to your actual FQDN (mail.example.com)

cd
openssl genrsa -des3 -out mail.alamal-sa.com.key 2048
chmod 600 mail.alamal-sa.com.key
openssl req -new -key mail.alamal-sa.com.key -out mail.alamal-sa.com.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in mail.alamal-sa.com.csr -signkey mail.alamal-sa.com.key -out mail.alamal-sa.com.crt
openssl rsa -in mail.alamal-sa.com.key -out mail.alamal-sa.com.key.nopass
mv mail.alamal-sa.com.key.nopass mail.alamal-sa.com.key
openssl req -new -x509 -extensions v3_ca -keyout cakey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 3650
chmod 600 mail.alamal-sa.com.key
chmod 600 cakey.pem
mv mail.alamal-sa.com.key /etc/pki/tls/private/
mv mail.alamal-sa.com.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/
mv cakey.pem /etc/pki/tls/private/
mv cacert.pem /etc/pki/tls/certs/

Step 2 (Modify the "/etc/postfix/main.cf" file)

Please note:

You can use what ever method you prefer to modify the files, some use vi and some use nano. I actually use the built in editor of WinSCP. I strongly encourage everyone to first save a backup copy of the file just in case something does not work as expected.

cd /etc/postfix/
cp main.cf main.cf.bk
nano main.cf

ensure that all of the following variables are not commented and share the listed values. Save the file once variables are altered. Also these variables are not listed in any order. Please change "mail.alamal-sa.com" to your actual FQDN (mail.example.com)

myhostname = mail.alamal-sa.com
smtpd_tls_auth_only = no
smtp_use_tls = yes
smtpd_use_tls = yes
smtp_tls_note_starttls_offer = yes
smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/pki/tls/private/mail.alamal-sa.com.key
smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/pki/tls/certs/mail.alamal-sa.com.crt
smtpd_tls_CAfile = /etc/pki/tls/certs/cacert.pem
smtpd_tls_loglevel = 1
smtpd_tls_received_header = yes
smtpd_tls_session_cache_timeout = 3600s
tls_random_source = dev:/dev/urandom

Step 3 (Modify the "/etc/postfix/master.cf" file)

Please note:

You can use what ever method you prefer to modify the files, some use vi and some use nano. I strongly encourage everyone to first save a backup copy of the file just in case something does not work as expected.

cd /etc/postfix/
cp master.cf master.cf.bk
nano master.cf

ensure that all of the following variables are not commented and share the listed values. Save the file once variables are altered. If not listed please place the variables below the line marked smtp inet n - n - - smtpd

smtps inet n - n - - smtpd
587 inet n - n - - smtpd
465 inet n - n - - smtpd

Step 4 (Modify the "/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf" file)

Please note: You can use what ever method you prefer to modify the files, some use vi and some use nano. I strongly encourage everyone to first save a backup copy of the file just in case something does not work as expected.

cd /etc/dovecot/
cp dovecot.conf dovecot.conf.bk
nano dovecot.conf

ensure that all of the following variables are not commented and share the listed values. Save the file once variables are altered. If not listed please insert the variables. Please change "mail.alamal-sa.com" to your actual FQDN (mail.example.com)

ssl = yes
ssl_cert = </etc/pki/tls/certs/mail.alamal-sa.com.crt
ssl_key = </etc/pki/tls/private/mail.alamal-sa.com.key
ssl_ca = </etc/pki/tls/certs/cacert.pem

Step 5 (Restarting the Dovecot and Postfix services)

Please note: The following commands will restart the mail services use by the server.

cd
service postfix reload
service postfix restart
service dovecot restart

Step 6 (Testing account settings)

Please note:

If any errors occurred after performing the previous step please restore all modified files with the generated backups

If all has went well we should now be able to add accounts with in your preferred email client.

I will list the settings for both MS Outlook and Thunderbird since these are the two most popular clients.

MS Outlook

Email: whoever.alamal-sa.com

username: whoever[at]alamal-sa.com

Password: what_ever_you_made_it

imap server: mail.alamal-sa.com use port 143 with TLS

smtp server: mail.alamal-sa.com use port 587 with TLS


Thunderbird

Email: whoever.alamal-sa.com

username: whoever[at]alamal-sa.com

Password: what_ever_you_made_it

imap server: mail.alamal-sa.com use port 143 with STARTTLS

smtp server: mail.alamal-sa.com use port 587 with STARTTLS


Things to consider

ZPanel by default disables iptables during initial setup. If you have re-enabled iptables to secure your server please don't forget to open the ports mentioned in this guide.

I will update this guide as needed and as requested if deemed appropriate.

Thanks for your time.
