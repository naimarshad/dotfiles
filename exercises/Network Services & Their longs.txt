/etc/init.d/xxxx
We have the startup scripts located in this very folder.

Very much like its ubuntu counter-part, CentOS has also begun migration to upstart for starting/stoping the services. But it is still backword compatible.

If we look at the "/etc/init.d/" folder we will see bunch of execuatable scripts for starting & stop of various sevices.

How these scripts are to be controlled by runlevel (that on which runlevel the particular script to be executed). It is that we have to see those files with in "/etc/rcX.d" folders for example if we have to stop one service in runlevel 5. We have to explore particular "/etc/rc5.d/" folder & if it is stopped in runlevel 3 then have to explore "/etc/rc3.d/" folder.

In those folders actually we will find the symlinks to these scripts which are in "/etc/init.d/". But something to notice in "/etc/rcX.d/" folders is 

service xxxx start/stop
